# snaplint
A tool for cleaning and refining your snaps

Snaplint is an attempt to encode best-practices for snapping software. To that end, snaplint will scan a `prime` directory generated by [snapcraft] and offer suggestions on how to improve your snap.

These are the currently supported rules:
 * copyright: check that copyright data is included for:
   * parts (under `usr/share/<part name>/copyright`)
   * staged packages
 * developer-cruft: make sure that header files, object files, and static libraries are not included
 * libraries: list those shared libraries in the snap which are not actually used by any apps
 
## Get started
You can run snaplint from a git checkout like so:

        $ ./bin/snaplint <path/to/project>

It's also available as a snap.

        $ snap install snaplint
        $ snaplint <path/to/project>
        
## Writing your own rules
Adding rules to snaplint is simple. Drop a file in `snaplint/rules/` which contains a python class that inherits from [`Rule`](snaplint/_rule.py). `self.path` will contain the path to your `prime` directory, and you can use convenience methods `self.get_dir_list` and `get_file_list` to get lists of files or directories in the snap.
