# snaplint
A tool for cleaning and refining your snaps

Snaplint is an attempt to encode best-practices for snapping software. To that end, snaplint will scan a `prime` directory generated by [snapcraft] and offer suggestions on how to improve your snap.

These are the currently supported rules:
 * copyright: check that copyright data for staged packages is included
 * developer-cruft: make sure that header files, object files, and static libraries are not included
 * libraries: list those shared libraries in the snap which are not actually used by any apps
 
## Get started
You can run snaplint from a git checkout like so:

        $ ./bin/snaplint <path/to/project/>prime/

It's also available as a snap.

        $ snap install snaplint
        $ snaplint <path/to/project/>prime/
